Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose\ninformation to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI\nvision models.

Strikingly,\n3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that\nkey social information is available in explicit body position but not in the\nlearned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise\nembeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions.

Nemotron Nano V2 VL delivers\nsignificant improvements over our previous model,\nLlama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-VL-8B, across all vision and text domains through major\nenhancements in model architecture, datasets, and training recipes. Nemotron\nNano V2 VL builds on Nemotron Nano V2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer LLM, and\ninnovative token reduction techniques to achieve higher inference throughput in\nlong document and video scenarios. We are releasing model checkpoints in BF16,\nFP8, and FP4 formats and sharing large parts of our datasets, recipes and\ntraining code.', 'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03929v1', 'submitted_date': '2025-11-06 00:10:19', 'categories': ['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV']}
{'title': 'Collaborative Agents for Automated Program Repair in Ruby', 'authors': ['Nikta Akbarpour', 'Mahdieh Sadat Benis', 'Fatemeh Hendijani Fard', 'Ali Ouni', 'Mohamed Aymen Saied'], 'arxiv_id': '2511.03925v1', 'summary': 'Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced rapidly with Large Language\nModels (LLMs), but most existing methods remain computationally expensive, and\nfocused on a small set of languages. Ruby, despite its widespread use in web\ndevelopment and the persistent challenges faced by its developers, has received\nlittle attention in APR research. In this paper, we introduce RAMP, a novel\nlightweight framework that formulates program repair as a feedback-driven,\niterative process for Ruby. RAMP employs a team of collaborative agents that\ngenerate targeted tests, reflect on errors, and refine candidate fixes until a\ncorrect solution is found. Unlike prior approaches, RAMP is designed to avoid\nreliance on large multilingual repair databases or costly fine-tuning, instead\noperating directly on Ruby through lightweight prompting and test-driven\nfeedback. Evaluation on the XCodeEval benchmark shows that RAMP achieves a\npass@1 of 67% on Ruby, outper-forming prior approaches. RAMP converges quickly\nwithin five iterations, and ablation studies confirm that test generation and\nself-reflection are key drivers of its performance. Further analysis shows that\nRAMP is particularly effective at repairing wrong answers, compilation errors,\nand runtime errors. Our approach provides new insights into multi-agent repair\nstrategies, and establishes a foundation for extending LLM-based debugging\ntools to under-studied languages.', 'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03925v1', 'submitted_date': '2025-11-06 00:00:17', 'categories': ['cs.SE', 'cs.AI']}
